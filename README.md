# Step 1: Requirements
You will need a fresh Ethereum wallet with some Sepolia ETH to interact with protocol smart contracts. We suggest using a fresh wallet for this purpose since the private key will be used inside the proving CLI
You will also need at least 1000 $PROVE tokens to stake to your prover. You can obtain these tokens through FAUCET ((https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgTpBL_wMWyyoxT6LxuMhiu-bex0cBg9kRTmxoKw3XOluOCA/viewform))
